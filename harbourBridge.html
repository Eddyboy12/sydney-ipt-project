                        Spanning Sydney Harbour at a maximum height of 134 metres, the Sydney Harbour Bridge is a spectacular feat of engineering and an enduring icon famous the world over. 
                        And despite efforts to capture Sydney's signature attraction on film, thereâ€™s nothing quite like seeing it for yourself. 
                        So come on over and witness the greatest of Sydney's attractions!!

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p><strong>Proposals for the Bridge</strong></p>
                    <p>There had been plans to build a bridge as early as 1815, when convict and noted architect Francis Greenway reputedly proposed to Governor Lachlan Macquarie that a bridge be built from the northern to the southern shore of the harbour. 
                        Nothing came of Greenway's suggestions, but the idea remained alive, and many further suggestions were made during the nineteenth century. 
                        In 1840, naval architect Robert Brindley proposed that a floating bridge be built. 
                        Engineer Peter Henderson produced one of the earliest known drawings of a bridge across the harbour around 1857. 
                        A suggestion for a truss bridge was made in 1879, and in 1880 a high-level bridge estimated at $850,000 was proposed. 
                        A unique three-span bridge was proposed in 1922 by Ernest Stowe with connections at Balls Head, Millers Point, and Balmain with a memorial tower and hub on Goat Island.

                    <p><strong>Planning for the Bridge</strong></p>
                    <p>Following World War I, plans to build the bridge again built momentum. 
                        Bradfield persevered with the project, fleshing out the details of the specifications and financing for his cantilever bridge proposal, and in 1921 he travelled overseas to investigate tenders. 
                        On return from his travels Bradfield decided that an arch design would also be suitable.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Construction of the Bridge</strong></p>
                    <p>The building of the bridge was under the management of Bradfield. 
                        An estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. 
                        Work on the bridge itself commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour.

                    <h2>Location</h2>
                    <p><strong>Where you can find it</strong></p>
                    <p>The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a direct link between the Sydney CBD and the North Shore. 
                        It can be seen above the Sydney Harbour and the best view of it can be seen from Circular Quay. 
                        For those who want the chance to walk across the bridge or climb the bridge, it is recommended to go to Milsons Point. 
                        Direct entry onto the bridge is most convenient from Milsons Point station.
                    </p>
